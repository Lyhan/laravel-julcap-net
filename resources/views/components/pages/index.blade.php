            <p>Knowledge is power but, what happens with this power if you forget what you learned?</p>
            <p>As an IT professional I enjoy learning new skills, at the same time I find it very
                frustrating when I forget something just because I have not used it in a while. The purpose for this
                website
                is
                to help me orginize my notes and at the same time help other people that
                might find this information useful.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy coding unfortunately design is not one of my skills.
                I want to especially thank <b><a style="color:#ffffff;"
                                                 href="http://www.j-bregninge.dk/">j-bregninge.dk</a></b>
                for helping me with the design of this site.</p>
